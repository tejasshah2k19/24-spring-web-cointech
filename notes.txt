form must have name attribute , that helps to give name to your data in form and 
then only it will pass from client to server [ form -> controller ] 

action attribute of form is used to submit the request on server 

method="post" when you want to pass data with basic encryption and not from the url 
method="get" data will pass via url 




when we have method as post -> then we need to create bean class to read user's input
